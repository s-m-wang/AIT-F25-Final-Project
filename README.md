# AIT-F25-Final-Project
Final Project for AIT F25

# Description
I want to make a Quizlet-like Flashcard studying site that also uses Anki-like study methods. 

# Use Cases or Use Stories
Anki is too non-user friendly! I want the fleibility of the app without having to sift through multiple video tutorials online.
Quizlet is not free, and I cannot customize my learning experience.
I want to section off certain flashcards to practice them.
I want to be able to communicate with other users on the site to ask them questions about their flashcards.


# Potential Research Topics
Question generating API that uses specified info to create questions
