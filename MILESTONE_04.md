URL for form 1 (from previous milestone) 
---
https://ait-f25-final-project.onrender.com/create

Special Instructions for Form 1
---
You cannot make a set that's using the name of a currently existing set for your account. Two accounts can have sets that are named 
same thing, but 1 account cannot have 2 of the same named sets.

URL for form 2 (for current milestone)
---
https://ait-f25-final-project.onrender.com/sets/your-set

Special Instructions for Form 2
---
Form 2 adds a card to the set, but it is supposed appear on the individual sets you make, so the URL will vary based on the set you made. Replace your-set
with the set you are currently on and have made. Also, pictures are generated based on the definition provided for each card. It only generates a picture
if the library is able to find a keyword that matches that picture. i.e. "dog" as a definition will generate a dog image, but "qsdfwd" will generate
nothing, so the card won't have an image, because that's what I set it to by default if the library can't find the card. So to test it properly,
please use an actual word or animal or common object. 

URL for form 3 (from previous milestone) 
---
https://ait-f25-final-project.onrender.com/login

Special Instructions for Form 3
---
There is an account already created. The user is "test" and pass is "test".
You can't have the same user and pass as someone else. There isn't a limit to how long or short the passwords can be. This is mostly
to make testing easier.

Optional project notes 
--- 
I have a fourth form. It's the trashcan. It pops up a delete form for all of the currently existing sets. The trashcan is a little slow to respond,
so you might have to try clicking it a few times.
